        <h1>More about myself.</h1>
        <h2>My Education.</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science and Information Technology student at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
        <p>I'm someone who is destined and wants to achieve a lot of things in life. One of the most important things is making my self financially secured
            and then make sure the rest follows. I'm thinking of making a a software company which will be successful in South Africa and be dominant.
            The only problem I have is that I don't now what will the company be about but I believe I'll get that soon. What is on my mind is providing
            top <em>Quality Service</em> to the people of my country.
        </p>
        <p>I finished my high school at <em>Mathunjwa High School</em> which is situated in a small village called <em>Ngwelu</em> that is between 
        <em>Vryhied and Nongoma.</em>I managed to obtain <em>7 distinctions</em> with an average of 85.67%. A lot of people approached me after 
        the results were released, a lot of them wanted to know how I studied so that they can also apply these techniques when they are studying.
        At Grade 12 it is important for one to know what they exactly want because it will prevent them from wasting a lot of their time.

        <h2>How is Varsity so far?</h2>
        <p>When I first arrived at University I couldn't handle a lot of stuff and it was mostly caused by time management. I was able to nevigate myself
            through al those issues and focused on my studies. a lotof people will say University is hard but on my perspective I would say it depends on
            what you really want as an individual.
            I'll finish my studies on record time and maintain a good academic record, this won't be for getting a job or something but to create a 
            good status for myself.
        </p>
        <h2>Where to after Varsity?</h2>
        <p>Previously I've mentioned that I want to build a large software company, now this won't be getting my self financially secured or creating
            generational wealth only but it will also put my people on the map. By <em>my people</em> I mean people who were previously disadvantaged
            which were mainly people who were classified as black. With the rapid growth of technology in our era one can not deny the fact that
            we must aquire some skills in order to cope with the change and survive. Now people have been warned several times about the change 
            but hey won't heed to the call. With the the system that we have in our country it makes it difficult for these people who were previously
            disadvantaged to gain access to more advanced materials or facilities of technology of this era. I believe that I'm the solution to things
            economical and commercial barrier with this company. I still need to give it some thought and come with an educated strategy of approaching
            it.
